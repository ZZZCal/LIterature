# ML used for properties:

## I. COF band gap

> No readily available database of band gaps for COFs.\
> COFs are potential.

> Ideal:
>> train set: Open Quantum Materials Database (OQMD) contain ~52300 inorganic compounds. (The Open Quantum Materials Database (OQMD): assessing the accuracy of DFT formation energies http://www.oqmd.org/download/)\

>> feature selection: 

>>> 9 elemental properties i.e., atomic number, group number, period number, electronegativity, electron affinity, melting temperature, boiling temeprature, density, and ionization energy. (Atomic Weights and Isotopic Compositions with Relative Atomic Masses. NIST Physical Measurement Laboratory. https://www.nist.gov/pml/ atomic-weights-and-isotopic-compositions-relative-atomic-masses)\

>>> 5 statistical quantities i.e., standard mean, geometric mean, standard deviation, maximum value and minimum value. (A General-Purpose Machine Learning Framework for Predicting Properties of Inorganic Materials. npj Comput. Mater. 2016, 2, 16028.)\
