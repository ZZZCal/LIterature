# Simulating large-scale amorphous materials with arbitrary resolution using deep learning

## Abstract
> absence of long-range order\
> standard computational simulation suffer from catastrophically unfavorable scaling of the required compute with system size\
> deep learning -- leverage the finite range of structural correlations for an autoregressive generation of disoredered mol aggregates\
> self-assembled nanoparticle aggregates and proceed to simulate monolayer amorphous carbon\
> bridge the gap between nanoscale and mesoscale of amouphous mol system.

## summary
> Using CdSe & Monolayer amorphous carbon -- structural correlation\
> core is learn a arbitrary size of material ot produce a desire size of material\
> give possibility to compute the physical properties of amourphous material
