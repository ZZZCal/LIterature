# Quasicrystals in Experiments

## Self-assembly of hydrogen-bonded two-dimensional quasicrystals
> 1. doi:10.1038/nature12993 (Nature 2014)
> 2. Use STM to study self-assembled monolayers of FcCOOH, form ***cyclic*** hydrogen-bonded ***pentamers***
> 3. Combine with simultaneously formed FcCOOH ***dimers***, produce 2D quasicrystallites, exhibit local ***5-fold*** symmetry
> 4. First quasicrystals in 1982, majority of which are ***binary or ternary metal alloys*** such as AlCuMn
> 5. Other types: terpolymer systems, liquid crystals and micelles, silica nanoparticles
> 6. $FcCH^2COOH$
