# Quasicrystals in Experiments

## Self-assembly of hydrogen-bonded two-dimensional quasicrystals
> 1. doi:10.1038/nature12993 (Nature 2014)
> 2. Use STM to study self-assembled monolayers of FcCOOH, form ***cyclic*** hydrogen-bonded ***pentamers***
> 3. Combine with simultaneously formed FcCOOH ***dimers***, produce 2D quasicrystallites, exhibit local ***5-fold*** symmetry
> 4. First quasicrystals in 1982, majority of which are ***binary or ternary metal alloys*** such as AlCuMn
> 5. Other types: terpolymer systems, liquid crystals and micelles, silica nanoparticles
> 6. FcCH2COOH will form periodic patterns, DFT calculation reveal their different assemble pattern on Au(111) surface

## Quasicrystallinity expressed in two-dimensional coordination networks
> 1. doi:10.1038/NCHEM.2507 (Nature chemistry 2016)
> 2. Introduce quasicrystallinity in surface-confined MOCNs with a nanoporous structure
> 3. dodecagonal quasicrystals tiling
> 4. Eu rare-earth metal centres with ditopic linear linker (p-NC-ph4-CN-p) on a smooth Au(111) surface
> 5. 4-, 5-, 6-fold mononuclear coordination nodes, present a 12-fold symmetry

# Theoretically

## Design of a Molecular Quasicrystal
> 1. doi:10.1002/cphc.200600278 (ChemPhysChem 2006)
> 2. It is feasible to construct a quasicrystal using organic molecules as building units (already achieved)
> 3. ***Penrose tiling*** (an aperiodic tiling) as basic structure template
