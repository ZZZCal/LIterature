## Quasicrystals: What do we know? What do we want to know? What can we know?
> 1. doi:10.1107/S2053273317016540 (Acta Cryst 2017)
> 2. Questions: 
* What are the ***condtions for the formation*** of stable quasicrystals in intermetallic systems?
* Can stable quasicrystals with symmetries ***other than 5-, 8-, 10- and 12-fold*** symmetries exist in intermetallics or in other chemical compounds?
* Do true quaternary and higher multinary quasicrystals exist?
* Can quasicrystals be thermodynamically stable at 0 K?

> 1. doi:10.1039/c4ra01354a (RSC Advances 2014)
> 2. Principles to design:
* to be ***tile-like***, molecules should be flat and rigid (fused 5-, 6- member ring)
* the bent of angles ~npai/5, 5-member ring
* >= 3 hygrogen bonds on each rhomb edge are needed

> 2. Rational strategy to assemble 2D, quasicrystals from branched DNA nanomotifs.
> 3. key is to balance the rigidity and flexibility of of DNA
> 4. DNA motifs: 
* both motifs have the same arm length (two neighboring vertices)
* both motifs have the same self-complementary sticky ends
> 5. experiments are demonstrated to verify the design.
